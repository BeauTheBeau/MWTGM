## Running the Bot

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [A Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- [A MongoDB Database](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository and enter the directory
git clone https://github.com/BeauTheBeau/MWTGM.git
cd MWTGM

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file with required environment variables
echo -e "TOKEN=<your bot token>\nMONGO_URI=<your mongo uri>"\nCLIENT_ID=<your client id>" > .env

# Start the bot
npm start
```

### Doesn't Work?
~~Cope.~~
- Open an issue and I (or someone else), will try to help you out
- If on a non Unix-like system, this may not work (especially the `echo` command)
- We have not tested this method of installation
- I plan to make this process easier in the future, by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Commands

MWT GameNights Bot uses Discord's new [Slash Commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands)
feature. 
This means that all commands are available in the Discord UI. 
To use a command, type `/` in the chat and select the command you want to use. 
This also provides an easily navigable list of all commands.

**TODO:** Complete list of commands (lol)
